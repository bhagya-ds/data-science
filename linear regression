LinearRegression: 

Linear regression is a common Statistical Data Analysis technique.
it is used to determine the  linear approach to modeling the relationship between dependant varaibles 
and independant variables. 


Linear Regression is the process of finding a line that best fits the data points available on the plot, 
so that we can use it to predict output values for inputs that are not present in the data set.

The case of one explanatory variable(independant) is called simple linear regression. 
example: salary vs experience

YearsExperience   	Salary
   1.1	            39343
   1.3            	46205
   1.5	            37731
    2	              43525
   2.2	            39891

For more than one explanatory variable, the process is called multiple linear regression
example: house prices

sq feet   bedrooms  bathroom  age  price
  500        2         1       5    25L
  600        3         2       10   27L
  750        4         3       3    57L
  250        1         1       2    26L
